# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props in React is the syntax used to pass attributes from a parent to a child component. Used in parentheses after constructor and super methods.

  Researched answer: Props are arguments passed into React components. In other words, if you have a parent component of car which had a state of color: red and you had a child component of Toyota which you also wanted to say was red, you could pass the color into the Toyota component using this.props.color.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is any change on the DOM, primarily user input such as mouse clicks, keyboard input, or a change in state triggered by user input.

  Researched answer: Document Object Model (DOM) events signal that a change has occurred in the DOM and can have event handlers tied to them which execute an action when triggered by the event. A good example is the onClick in JavaScript and JSX, which registers the DOM event of a user click and executes some sort of action as a result of that click.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is programming centered on objects, which can contain both data and functions. Functional programming centers on functions which receive data in order to execute code.

  Researched answer: The major difference lies in how the two handle data. In functional programming, data is not stored in objects and functions are the only thing used to change that data. In object-oriented programming, data can be stored inside of objects and is changed through the methods that are also stored inside of the objects.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is number that has a decimal place and an integer is a number without a decimal place.

  Researched answer: A floating point number or float is a number that contains a decimal point. Ruby will consider any number written with a decimal a float and any number without a decimal it will consider an integer. If a float and an integer are added together, the result will be a float.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Ruby will automatically return the last line of code run within a method.

  Researched answer: A method in Ruby will return the result of the last evaluated expression. This means that you do not need to add a return inside of your method to indicate your desired output, Ruby takes that into account and will return that expression's output anyway.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: An instance variable is a variable which starts with an @ symbol and is used to give objects the ability to store data.

2. PostgreSQL: Postgre Structured Query Language (PostgreSQL) is a free and open-source database manager which supports SQL querying. If I'm understanding it correctly, it's similar to yarn or npm but where those managers are for libraries PostgreSQL is for databases.

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework for the Ruby programming language. It seems that Ruby on Rails is to Ruby what React is to Javascript.

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a layer between an OOP language and a database structure, eliminating the need for the OOP programmer to write SQL code to extract data from database itself.

5. Active Record: Active Record is a type of ORM.
